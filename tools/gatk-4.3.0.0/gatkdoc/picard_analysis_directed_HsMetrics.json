The metrics\n in this class fall broadly into three categories:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003cul\u003e\n     \u003cli\u003eBasic sequencing metrics that are either generated as a baseline against which to evaluate other\n     metrics or because they are used in the calculation of other metrics.  This includes things like\n     the genome size, the number of reads, the number of aligned reads etc.\u003c/li\u003e\n     \u003cli\u003eMetrics that are intended for evaluating the performance of the wet-lab assay that generated the data.\n     This group includes metrics like the number of bases mapping on/off/near baits, %selected, fold 80 base\n     penalty, hs library size and the hs penalty metrics. These metrics are calculated prior to some of the\n     filters are applied (e.g. low mapping quality reads, low base quality bases and bases overlapping in the middle\n     of paired-end reads are all counted).\n     \u003c/li\u003e\n     \u003cli\u003eMetrics for assessing target coverage as a proxy for how well the data is likely to perform in downstream\n     applications like variant calling. This group includes metrics like mean target coverage, the percentage of bases\n     reaching various coverage levels, and the percentage of bases excluded by various filters. These metrics are computed\n     using the strictest subset of the data, after all filters have been applied.\u003c/li\u003e\n \u003c/ul\u003e",
